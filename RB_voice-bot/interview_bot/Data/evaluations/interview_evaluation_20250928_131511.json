    "feedback_summary": "The candidate struggled significantly with communication during the interview, leading to a disjointed conversation. Kirti appeared to repeat the interviewer's prompts rather than responding with relevant information about their background or projects. This suggests a lack of engagement or understanding of the interview process. The technical skills mentioned in the resume align with the job description, but these were not effectively communicated during the interview."

    "score": 3,
    "feedback": "While the resume indicates a strong technical background in AI, machine learning, and software development, the interview did not showcase these skills. The candidate failed to discuss any specific projects or experiences, such as the CadIntel project, which could have demonstrated their technical abilities and alignment with the Generative AI Developer role."
