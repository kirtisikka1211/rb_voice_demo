The candidate did not engage in any meaningful conversation or demonstrate their skills and qualifications. There was a lack of alignment with the job description, and the candidate's response was not relevant to the interview context. This indicates a significant communication barrier or misunderstanding."

There were no filler words or hesitations, but this was due to the absence of meaningful dialogue rather than effective communication. The response in Finnish ('Mutta kun se selviää') was out of context, indicating a possible language barrier or misunderstanding of the interview setting."
